  "TITLE": "Our Story",
  "BODY": [
    "The Story Engine is a space for young writers of all ages to express themselves through stories, poems, plays and any other form of creative writing.",
    "We can trace our DNA back to a TED talk by Dave Eggers, who explains why along with Ninive Calegari he decided to set up a writing centre for children in San Francisco in 2002.",
    "That talk has inspired hundreds of people all over the world to establish writing centres in their own communities with a common belief that writing can change our lives for the better.",
    "In 2014 The Ministry of Stories secured funding from NESTA and Arts Council England to explore how they could use digital tools to support writers and that's when The Story Engine was developed by The Workshop and one of the young writers created The Inspirational Jellyfish!",
    "When schools closed in 2020 the Ministry of Stories asked The Workshop to restart the Story Engine, so we did, and now we’re making it even better. We’ve had funding from Innovate UK and now we’ve put all the IP and a fresh team into a new company (TSE Ventures Limited) that will develop the platform and build a global community of writers and mentors."
