  "TITLE": "Our Story",
  "BODY": [
    "The Story Engine is a space for young writers of all ages to express themselves through stories, poems, plays and any other form of creative writing.",
    "We can trace our DNA back to a TED talk by Dave Eggers, who explains why, along with Ninive Calegari, he decided to set up a writing centre for children in San Francisco in 2002.",
    "That talk has inspired hundreds of people all over the world to establish writing centres in their own communities with a common belief that writing can change our lives for the better.",
    "In 2014 The Ministry of Stories secured funding from NESTA and Arts Council England to explore how they could use digital tools to support writers. That's when The Story Engine was developed by The Workshop. This was also the spawning of the Inspirational Jellyfish, our tentacled tutor, which was an idea that came from one of the young writers!",
    "When schools closed in 2020 the Ministry of Stories asked The Workshop to restart the Story Engine, so we did, and now we’re making it even better. We’ve had funding from Innovate UK, helping us to put all our Ideas and Intellectual Property into a new company (TSE Ventures Limited) with a fresh team, that will develop the platform and build a global community of writers and mentors.",
    "We believe in the power of storytelling to help young people process the complex feelings and emotions they experience.  Our ambition is to engage one million writers around the world and help them to create powerful stories. Working with writing centres, community projects, and children at home, we provide a creative outlet that supports writers outside (and sometimes inside) of the classroom."
